Project overview:

Our calculator can calculate basic arithmetic operations like add,sub,mul,div. Moreover, these operations can be done:
  a.	Greatest common divisor(GCD) and least common multiple(LCM) of two numbers.
  b.	Factorial of a number
  c.	Fibonacci number
  d.	nCr, nPr
  e.	Exponent (i.e. a^b)
  f.	Modulo
  g.	Big mod
  h.	Primality check of a number
  i.	divisor , multiple check
  j.	Square root of a number
And many operations which are needed in problem solving!
